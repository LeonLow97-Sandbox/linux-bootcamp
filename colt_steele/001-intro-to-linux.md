# Introduction

## Why learn the command line?

1. More control over your machine
    - Mastering the command line gives you far greater control over your machine. Can run commands to change permissions, view hidden files, interact with databases, start servers, manage processes, etc.

2. Faster
    - Can perform tasks much faster than you could using a GUI.

3. Can automate many tasks
    - Can do things like create 1000 files all with unique names using a single command. Doing this with the GUI would take ages.

4. Available everywhere
    - Can run on Linux and MAC. Quite different in Windows machine.

5. Needed for Cloud Computing
    - Cloud services are operated via a command line interface. If you plan on running any projects in the cloud or using cloud resources, need command line skills.

## The World of Operating Systems

- Most operating systems can be grouped into 2 families:
    1. Windows
    2. Unix

## What is Unix?

- Operating system developed at Bell Labs in the mid 1960s.
- Multi-user operating systems and hierarchical file systems.
- "grandfather" of many modern operating systems used today.
- Unix philosophy emphasizes modular software design and the creation of small individual programs that can be combined to perform complex tasks.
    - Write programs that do one thing and do it well.
    - Write programs to work together.
    - Write programs to handle text streams, because that is a universal interface.

## Linux, GNU and Kernels

- **GNU**: software with everything useful in Unix system.
- **Kernel**: part of a OS that facilitates interactions between hardware and software. A kernel is not an operating system. A kernel is a computer program that forms the core of an operating system and manages critical tasks like memory management, task scheduling, managing hardware.
- **Linux**: refers both to the kernel and all the software that is part of the Unix operating system.

## Terminals, Shells and Bash

- **Shell**
    - Computer interface to an operating system.
    - Exposes the OS's services to human users or other programs.
    - The shell sits on top of the OS as it takes our commands and gives them to the operating system to perform.
- **Terminal**
    - Program that runs a shell.
    - Terminal --> Shell (bash, powershell, zshrc) --> OS
- **bash**
    - On most Linux-based systems, the default shell program is `Bash`.
    - bash runs on almost every version of Unix and Unix-like systems.
